## Examples for using qcir_sim package

This folder contains the following examples:

1. Benchmarking how many qubits can we simulate using Vector and Tensor simulation
2. Sampling the Qubits from a Quantum simulation
3. Calculating the expectation values of `<Ψ| Op |Ψ>`

## Setting up

Install Pandas in the virtual environment since it is required in `benchmark.py`.

```sh
uv pip install pandas # required in benchmark.py
```

or

```sh
pip install pandas
```
